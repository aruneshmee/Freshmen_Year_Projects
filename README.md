These are some games that I built in my freshman year


# TESLA GAME

Saving Elon Musk's Roadster from going into space
 
In this task, you will be developing a game to allow the user to “save” Elon Musk’s prized Roadster from being sent into space. 
The Story:
You find your way to SpaceX the night before the Roadster is mounted atop the rocket which is to send it into space.  The building is dark and the roadster is hidden somewhere in large open dark room (15x15).  In addition to the roadster, two other cars (a Yugo and ford pinto) are being stored in this facility as well. 

BTW: Elon Musk is sleeping somewhere in the same room and you have to avoid waking him to find your way to the roadster. Once awoken he will randomly move through the building looking for you. If he lands next to you, you can get away from him only once. The second time you will be the “Starman” and blasted into space with his roadster. Once he is a awake your only chance to avoid being “Starman” is to make your escape in his roadster. If you get into either of the other two cars you will be caught and become the “Starman”.
